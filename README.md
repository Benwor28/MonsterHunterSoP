# MonsterHunterSoP
This repository is to make a generic SoP HTML app using MonsterHunter as an example.

Index.js is the main code (JavaScript section), while MHSmashOrPassV1 is the HTML file.

Each monster has its image from the wiki grabbed (found in Monster images). Themes are included if the monster has a unique one. <sub>generic themes have been added for non-unique ones </sub>
